This month (August of 2019), we started holding regularly scheduled _Roadmap
Calls_, where the developers and release engineers working on Genesis
provide updates, explain where we are at in the roadmap, where we want to
go, and answer questions form anyone who pops in.

We'll be holding these calls on the **3rd Tuesday** of every month at **11am
EDT**.  More details can be found on the [Community Roadmap Call page][1]
(on genesisproject.io).

We hope that these calls help to put faces to names, and remind everyone
involves that the people who create Genesis and the people who use Genesis
are just that: people.  It's all too easy to get lost in the clean lines of
GitHub and forget that behind those screen names are living, breathing human
beings.

We also want to have a forum in which to discuss the direction of the
project, its velocity in pursuing that direction, and more.  So [stop on
in][1], say hi, and join in the fun!

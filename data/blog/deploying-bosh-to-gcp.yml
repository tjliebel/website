Do you have a Google Cloud Platform account? Do you wish things were more automated and just easier to manage? Want to do that using BOSH, but wish there was a simple way to deploy BOSH? Me too. So, let's do that. 

When this is all said and done, you will have a working environment in GCP with a Bastion Host to access the network, a BOSH Director to manage all the deployments, and a secure Vault instance to manage all of the credentials and certificates for the deployment. 

To get started you need a fresh GCP project with a service account to perform the automation tasks for us. Create a service account with the following roles: 

    * `Compute Engine` > `Computer Admin`
    * `Service Accounts` > `Service Account User` 
    * `Storage` > `Storage Admin`

Also, create and save the service account key as json to be used later. 

## Getting Started with Terraform

Terraform is a simple way to manage our infrastructure on GCP. Terraform documentation and binaries can be found at [https://terraform.io](https://terraform.io). Clone [this repo](https://github.com/genesis-community/terraforms) to get started

    $ git clone https://github.com/genesis-community/terraforms

We will be working in the gcp lab area, here you will find a sample terraform config file that is ready to go, only needing a few inputs from you. So make a `gcp.tfvars` file in the gcp lab area.

    $ cd terraforms/lab/gcp
    $ vim gcp.tfvars

Here are the variables that you need to define and what the file should look like:

    project_id                  = "your-gcp-project-id"
    service_account_credentials = "path/to/your-sa-creds.json"
    service_account_email       = "your-service-account@google-assigned-email.com"
    
    ssh_creds_pub               = { bastion-user = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" }
    ssh_creds_priv              = { bastion-user = "~/.ssh/id_rsa" }


The `service_account_creds` is the `.json` downloaded above. 

With those set, get things going with the short and sweet:

    $ make

Terraform will now compile all that information into a plan for GCP. When prompted, type `yes`. 

    Plan: 9 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
    
      Enter a value: yes

At this point, terraform will do what it needs to do and deploy the network, subnet, firewall rules, and the bastion host VM. When the dust settles, there should be a nice output looking something this: 

    Apply complete! Resources: 9 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    
    ~~~ Terraform raw outputs ~~~
    
    For configuring your proto-BOSH:
    
      Static IP:             10.0.0.3
      Range (CIDR):          10.0.0.0/24
      Gateway:               10.0.0.1
      DNS:                   169.254.169.254
    
      GCP Project ID:        your-gcp-project-id
      Service account Creds: path-to-your-sa-creds.json
      Network Name:          genesis-bosh-network
      Subnet Name:           genesis-bosh-subnetwork
      Availability Zone:     us-east4-a
    
    To access the bastion host:
    
      ssh -i ~/id_rsa.pub bastion-user@gcp.assigned.ip.addr

That output provides the answers to most of questions that Genesis will ask when setting up the proto-BOSH and what you need to ssh to the bastion host. You can easily get that info again using:

    $ make info


## Setting up the Bastion Host

Go ahead and ssh onto the bastion host using the `ssh` command outputted after the deploy. 
First thing, setup your git config.

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "Your Email"

This bastion host is currently a fresh ubuntu VM. As part of the Terraform config, we pushed over a script that will get us what  we need to stand up our proto-BOSH using Genesis.

    $ sudo jumpbox system

The things being installed by this script include `bosh`,`cf`, and `genesis` as well as some other utilities such as [safe](https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe), [spruce](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce), and [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq). 

To See what is installed, you can run `jumpbox` with no arguments.

    $ jumpbox
    ~~~ jumpbox art ~~~
    >> Checking jumpbox installation
       jumpbox installed - jumpbox v55
       ruby installed - ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
       bosh installed - version 3.0.1-712bfd7-2018-03-13T23:26:43Z
       cf installed - cf version 6.46.0+29d6257f1.2019-07-09

       sipcalc installed - sipcalc 1.1.6
    
       git user.name  is 'Troy Liebel'
       git user.email is 'tliebel@starkandwayne.com'
    
       To bootstrap this installation,  try `jumpbox system`
       To set up your personal environment: `jumpbox user`
       To update this copy of jumpbox, use: `jumpbox sync`
       To create a new local user account:  `jumpbox useradd`


## Creating a Temporary Vault

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is useful tool that Genesis taps into to generate and manage SSH keys, certs, and more. Once we get BOSH up and running, we will deploy an instance of Vault to manage those things, but until then we need something to get us started. We can do that by starting a local vault instance. 

Use the [Safe CLI](https://github.com/starkandwayne/safe) to startup a local instance of Vault.  Open up another shell session, or tmux pane on the bastion host and run:

    $ safe local --memory  --as temp-vault

Now you should have an in memory Vault instance named `temp-vault` running and targeted. 

## Deploying the Proto-BOSH

First thing is to use Genesis to initialize BOSH. 

    $ mkdir ~/ops
    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init bosh -k bosh

Genesis will prompt to select a vault, there should only be the one temporary vault that we created for us to select.

    Select Vault:
    
      1) temp-vault   (insecure) http://127.0.0.1:8201 (default)
    
    Select choice > 1

With that, Genesis will check for the newest kit for bosh and initialize a `bosh-deployments` repository for us.

    Verifying availability of selected vault...ok
    
    Downloading Genesis kit bosh (latest version)...
    
    Initialized empty Genesis repository in ./bosh-deployments
     - using vault at http://127.0.0.1:8201 (insecure)
     - using the bosh/1.4.0 kit.

Next is to tell Genesis what it has to work with to write an environment file for our BOSH director. 

To get started, move into the directory Genesis created and run `genesis new` with a name for the environment, ie `bosh-gcp`. This is our first BOSH, so `y` when asked if this is a proto-BOSH.

    $ cd bosh-deployments
    $ genesis new bosh-gcp
    Setting up new environment bosh-gcp...
    
    Using vault at http://127.0.0.1:8201.
    Verifying availability...ok
    
    
    Is this a proto-BOSH director?
    [y|n] > y

The info needed to answer just about all of the questions below can be found from the `make` that we did on your local machine (you can do `make info` to get that information again). If you did not make any changes to the `.tf` Terraform config, your answers should be the same as mine for everything except the Project-ID and the GCP credentials. 

The first chunk of questions are regarding the networking for the BOSH director.  

    What static IP do you want to deploy this BOSH director on?
    > 10.0.0.3
    
    What network should this BOSH director exist in (in CIDR notation)?
    > 10.0.0.0/24
    
    What default gateway (IP address) should this BOSH director use?
    > 10.0.0.1

This is the DNS resolver that GCP uses. More info can be found in the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns#access_by_internal_DNS).

    What DNS servers should BOSH use? (leave value empty to end)
    1st value > 169.254.169.254
    2nd value > 

This is where Genesis gets into the GCP specific questions, go ahead and choose item `4` here.  

    What IaaS will this BOSH director orchestrate?
      1) VMWare vSphere
      2) Amazon Web Services
      3) Microsoft Azure
      4) Google Cloud Platform
      5) OpenStack
      6) BOSH Warden
    
    Select choice > 4

These are the two questions that are unique to you. The GCP creds are the service account credentials, provide them as the raw json contents of the `.json` key file.

    What is your GCP project ID?
    > your-gcp-project-id
    
    What are your GCP credentials (generally supplied as a JSON block)? (Enter <CTRL-D> to end)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    {
      ~~~ Service Account creds as raw JSON ~~~
    }

Genesis now wants the network, subnetwork, and availability zone for the director to operate on. 

    What is your GCP network name?
    > genesis-bosh-network
    
    What is your GCP subnetwork name?
    > genesis-bosh-subnetwork
    
    What availability zone do you want the BOSH VM to reside in?
    > us-east4-a

We need to give the environment VM at least one tag. ie `bosh`.

    What tags would you like to be set on the BOSH VM? (leave value empty to end)
    1st value > bosh
    2nd value >

If you have a desire to look at the environment file at this point, go ahead. Otherwise, the environment file is ready to go without any edits. We can let Genesis take the info we provided and provision the environment.

    Would you like to edit the environment file?
    [y|n] > n
     - auto-generating credentials (in secret/bosh/gcp/bosh)...
     - auto-generating certificates (in secret/bosh/gcp/bosh)...
    New environment bosh-gcp provisioned!
    
    To deploy, run this:
    
      genesis deploy 'bosh-gcp'

With that, Genesis has generated passwords and X.509 certs that the BOSH director needs, added them to the temporary vault and we are ready to deploy our BOSH director. 

    $ genesis deploy bosh-gcp

This will likely take some time as it needs to compile quite a few packages. 

## Preparing the BOSH Director for use
The BOSH director is now deployed and running, but it needs a couple more things before we can use it to deploy anything else. Those being an Ubuntu Xenial stemcell and a cloud config. Luckily, we have tools in the BOSH Genesis kit and Terraform makefile to make these things pretty easy for us.

## Uploading Stemcells
Let's start with logging into our new BOSH director. When the BOSH director finished deploying, Genesis outputted a few different command options that are now available to us. Including what we need to login. 

    $ genesis do bosh-gcp -- login
    
    Using vault at http://127.0.0.1:8201.
    Verifying availability...ok
    
    Running login addon for bosh-gcp
    Logging you in as user 'admin'...
    Using environment 'https://10.0.0.3:25555'
    
    Email (): admin
    Password ():
    
    Successfully authenticated with UAA
    
    Succeeded

Now we can use Genesis' handy `upload-stemcells` option which is a convenient way to upload stemcells. I chose the latest stemcell that was available at the time. 

    $ genesis do bosh-gcp -- upload-stemcells
    
    Using vault at http://127.0.0.1:8201.
    Verifying availability...ok
    
    Running upload-stemcells addon for bosh-gcp
    
    Select the release family for the google-kvm ubuntu-xenial stemcell you wish to upload:
      1) 456.x (2 minor versions available)
      2) 315.x (14 minor versions available)
      3) 250.x (19 minor versions available)
      4) 170.x (5 minor versions available)
    
    Select choice > 1
    
    Select one of the available 456.x versions:
      1) 456.3
      2) 456.1
    
    Select choice > 1
    
    ~~~ Upload Details ~~~
    
    Succeeded
    
    Upload another?
    [y|N] > n


## Updating Cloud Config

BOSH Cloud Configs can be a bit hand-wavey and hard to follow. So, to streamline the process a bit, we have a function in our Genesis Terraform repo that will output a simple cloud config to get us going. 

From your local machine, in the terraform directory:

    $ make cc

Paste that YAML into a file on the bastion host vm, ie `cloud-config.yml`. Upload that to the BOSH Director.

    $ bosh -e bosh-gcp update-cloud-config cloud-config.yml

This cloud config is pretty basic. It defines defaults for the network, vm types, disk, and availability zone. We also defined another network for the Vault that we will be deploying shortly. 

## Deploying a Real Vault

We deployed a local vault in memory, which works great and does everything we need it to do... _Except_ persist outside of the memory of the bastion host, which is a pretty important feature for this entire deployment's credentials. Luckily, we now have a BOSH director that can deploy a Vault for us.

Additionally, there is a Genesis kit for Vault that will do most of the heavy lifting for us. From the bastion host, move outside the `bosh-deployments` directory and initialize the new Vault.

    $ cd ~/ops
    $ genesis init -k vault

Select the temporary vault for the BOSH director to use to get this new deployment running.

    Select Vault:
    
      1) temp-vault    (insecure) http://127.0.0.1:8201 (default)
    
    Select choice > 1

This Genesis kit is quite a bit more simple than the BOSH kit. The only question it will ask at this time is if this is our Genesis Vault, which it is, so `y` when prompted.

    $ cd vault-deployments
    $ genesis new vault-gcp

You can try to deploy right now, but Genesis will complain about the AZs. Vault by default looks to be in 3 availability zones. In our case, one AZ is fine for this lab environment. It is worth noting that in prod Vault should be distributed across availability zones to prevent losing all the creds to your entire deployment from a single point of failure. 

Open up the `vault-gcp.yml` and add these params:

    params:
      availability_zones: [z1]
      stemcell_os: ubuntu-xenial

We also add the `stemcell_os` param because the Vault kit might be expecting different stemcells, but the stemcells we gave to BOSH are Xenial. 

Now we are ready to deploy. This will also take some time, but slightly less than the proto-BOSH. 

    $ genesis deploy bosh-gcp


## Transferring Secrets to the new Vault

We now have a full fledged Vault instance deployed and ready to go.  Initialize the new Vault.

    $ genesis do vault-gcp -- init

Export all the creds from the local `temp-vault` to this new Vault.

    $ safe -T temp-vault export | safe -T bosh-gcp import


## Showing Genesis the new Vault

Genesis has a convenient feature as of 2.6.17 that keeps track of what vault is being in each deployment. This is great if you are multitasking. For example, you are working in a local dev environment, then switch lanes to deploy to your GCP environment to try deploying while still targeting the local vault. Previously, this would blow up as the wrong creds are being used to deploy. Now, Genesis keeps track of this for you and use the proper vault for your deployment. 

Run `genesis secrets-provider` to see what Genesis is currently using.  

    $ genesis secrets-provider
    
    Secrets provider for vault deployment at /home/bastion-user/ops/vault-deployments:
             Type: Safe/Vault
              URL: http://127.0.0.1:8201 (insecure)
      Local Alias: temp-vault
           Status: ok

As Expected, Genesis is looking to the temp-vault still. We can go ahead and swap that over now.

    $ genesis secrets-provider bosh-gcp
    
    Secrets provider for vault deployment at /home/bastion-user/ops/vault-deployments:
             Type: Safe/Vault
              URL: https://10.0.0.5 (noverify)
      Local Alias: bosh-gcp
           Status: ok

As stated above, this is per deployment. So we have to do the same in the bosh deployment.

    $ cd ~/ops/bosh-deployments
    $ genesis secrets-provider bosh-gcp
    
    Secrets provider for bosh deployment at /home/bastion-user/ops/bosh-deployments:
             Type: Safe/Vault
              URL: https://10.0.0.5 (noverify)
      Local Alias: bosh-gcp
           Status: ok

With all of our secrets _safely_ transferred, we can shut down the temp-vault. 


That is a BOSH director primed and ready to deploy whatever you need in GCP! Check out other what other Genesis kits are available at [Genesis Community](https://github.com/genesis-community).
